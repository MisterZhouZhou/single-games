The world of AI is rapidly moving beyond single-purpose models towards intelligent, autonomous multi-agent systems. Building these multi-agent systems, however, presents new challenges. That is why today, we have introduced Agent Development Kit (ADK) at Google Cloud NEXT 2025, a new open-source framework from Google designed to simplify the full stack end-to-end development of agents and multi-agent systems. ADK empowers developers like you to build production-ready agentic applications with greater flexibility and precise control.

ADK is the same framework powering agents within Google products like Agentspace and the Google Customer Engagement Suite (CES). By open-sourcing ADK, we aim to provide developers with powerful, flexible tools to build in the rapidly evolving agent landscape. The ADK is designed to be flexible, use different models and build production ready agents for different deployment environments.
